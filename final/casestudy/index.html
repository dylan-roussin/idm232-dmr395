                    For IDM 232, the task was to create a recipe website that could access a database which stored 
                    the recipes. The project focused on using MySQL in order to make changes to the database through the website,
                    and the queries were built using PHP to allow for user input. The project also had a search functionality and
                    image upload. 
                </p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to improve  using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS by creating a website that 
                    used each of these technologies. The task was the create a database to store recipes and associated 
                    data, a page to list categories, a page to list recipes that fit a selected category, a recipe detail 
                    page, as well as a search functionality and search result page.
                </p>
                <p id="p-spacer">
                    Pages for an administator were also created, including a page listing
                    all recipes, a page to create a recipe, and a page showing recipe details
                    along with a way to edit and delete the selected recipe. 
                </p>

                <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to accomplish the task of storing recipes, a database was created that could store 
                    details about each recipe, such as its name, description, content, category, and associated image.
                    The database was accessed using MySQL queries built from HTML forms that collected user info, and
                    using PHP in order to display the data on the page. Recipe pages are formed formed
                    from variables pulled from the database that allow for their to only be one version of 
                    a page that changes its information based on its ID. 
                </p>

                <p id="p-spacer">
                    In order to display a list of categories, a SQL query which selected all unique
                    categories was used. This was especially important, as the category names and amount 
                    could vary, as the user to able to add and delete recipes. Most tasks required accessing
                    the database, storing the result in an array, and accessing variables in the array for 
                    manipulation.
                </p>
